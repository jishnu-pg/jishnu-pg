**Full-Stack Developer | Django • React • API Engineering**

I build scalable web applications with clean architecture and strong UX.  
My core stack is **Django + Django REST Framework** on the backend and **React + Redux** on the frontend.

Currently focused on building reliable products, improving performance, and writing maintainable, production-ready code.
